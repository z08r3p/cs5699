TU2983: Advanced Databases Individual Assignment 3 Transaction Form and Software Installer
   IMPORTANT NOTE: This assignment continues from the work you have done in “Individual Assignment 1  2”. You are required to re-use same Visual Basic Project that you created for “Individual Assignment 1  2”, or use an improved version of the same Visual Basic Project for “Individual Assignment 1  2”:
1. You will use the same topic that was previously assigned to you in “Individual Assignment 1”.
2. All windows forms that you previously created for “Individual Assignment 1  2” must be used, or be improved.
3. The database file that you previously created for “Individual Assignment 1  2” must be used, or be improved.
4. The pictures that you have previously collected for “Individual Assignment 1  2” must be used.
5. You will add new windows forms required for this assignment to your previous Visual Basic Project.
6. Evaluation of “Individual Assignment 3” will only be made on the following Tasks:
     ASSIGNMENT 3 will be evaluated using your final program that is installed using your SETUP.EXE
 installer only, and no longer through Visual Studio.
   TASK 1: Build a form for the user to MAKE ORDERS for multiple products.
1. The ORDER for multiple products must be made in a single form, using a single ORDER ID.
2. The MAKE ORDER form must show/display calculated values such as SUB-TOTALS and TOTALS. However, these calculated values do not need to be stored in the database.
3. The ORDER for products must be processed as a TRANSACTION.
4. When entering data into the MAKE ORDER form, all items in the order
must be successfully COMMITed into the database, or ROLLED-BACK com代 写program、 c++，java

 IMPORTANT: Your evaluator will test ACID compliance of your
ORDER TRANSACTION by deliberately causing an error when entering data for the order.
TASK 2: Build a form that the user can use to VIEW existing ORDERS.
  Create an INSTALLER for your program and a Splash Screen (i.e. main product title screen)
Use a “Setup and Deployment” project in Visual Studio to create the installer.
 IMPORTANT: “Express” versions of Visual Studio do not have the “Setup and Deployment” project option.
Make sure there is a Desktop shortcut for executing your installed program.
Design your Splash Screen appropriately to suit your individual topic. You will also be evaluated based on the aesthetics and appearance of your Splash Screen.
Make sure your FULL NAME, MATRIC NUMBER and SHOP/PROJECT NAME are labeled on the Splash Screen.
Create a *.ZIP/*.RAR containing your project’s contents, and upload it to UKMfolio (*see NOTE below).
Compress the following folders in a single *.ZIP/*.RAR file:
a. One folder labelled as _SOURCECODE, that contains you entire VB project source code,
database, and pictures.
b. One folder labelled as _INSTALLER, that contains your program’s SETUP.EXE file and installer
(*.msi) files (i.e. everything in the ‘Debug’ directory of your “Setup and Deployment”).
*** IMPORTANT ***: Your *.ZIP/*.RAR must not exceed 125mb (Megabytes). If it does exceed 125mb, you need to reduce the resolution of all your pictures, in order to reduce their file size.
Upload your *.ZIP/*.RAR file to UKMfolio, at the Lab Assignment 3 Submission Link.
  SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING:
1. Your project’s complete *.ZIP/*.RAR file, which must be uploaded to UKMfolio.
2. *** NOTE ***: If your ZIP/RAR file exceeds 125mb, upload your ZIP/RAR to any file sharing website as a PUBLIC SHARE.
Copy the PUBLIC SHARE LINK and paste in into a *.TXT file. Then Upload Your PUBLIC SHARE LINK’s TXT file to UKMfolio. Due date: Sunday 19th January 2025, 11:59pm.
